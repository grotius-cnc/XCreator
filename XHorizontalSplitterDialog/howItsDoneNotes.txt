# How its done notes.

1. The "XTemplate.h" file is a auto generated file by the XCreator widget layout designer program :
 
	cd XDesignerDialog/build/
	./XDesignerDialog 
	
2. The "XLayout.h" file is a renamed file. The original name was "XTemplate.h".

	Inside the XLayout.h file, some text is edited from "XTemplate" to "XLayout."
	
3. The "CMakeLists.txt" is edited at one line, the following line is added :

	"${XCREATOR_DIR}/XTemplate.h"
	
4. The "XMainWindow.h" file is then edited in a code editor, the "XTemplate.h" is integrated into the "XMainWindow.h".

5. The project is build.

	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
