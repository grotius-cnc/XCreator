# XCreator

For a new debian installation you could consider my latest way of installing Debian. I had some problem's with non-free filmware using original debian iso's.

To create a debian 11 system on a usb, your pc is becoming the docking station.
The usb boots the Debian 11 during startup of your pc, you have to select the boot device during startup.

Step 1. Create a bootable usb containing :

	https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-11.5.0-amd64-lxqt+nonfree.iso
	
Step 2. Run the usb in live mode. When desktop starts, run the desktop icon for cinnamon installation. 

Now you can place a second usb in your pc that will have your new debian installation on it. Use a large usb or sdd disk for this.
You need to create 2 partitions yourself during the installation process. The comments of the cinnamon installer program are good enough to understand howto.

My partitions looks like :
	1. Partition : 8Mb unformatted with grub flag.
	2. Partition : ..Mb flag boot, mount / 
	
	
After installation reboot your pc into the new usb.
	


Requirments:

	This project is programmed for using with modern OpenGL 3.0 or higher.
	If you want to use a lower OpenGL version, 
	you have to downgrade the openGL shader language inside the xcreator code yourself. 
	
To clone this repository including installing the submodules :

	./setup
	
To build a single XCreator program :

	cd /XCreator/XDesignerDialog/build/
	rm -rf *
	cmake ..

To build a single submodule like glad, zlib, learnopengl, libpng, soil, freetype-2.12.1, glew-2-2.0, glfw-3.3.7 :
	
	cd XCreator/vendor/<vendorName>
	mkdir -p build 
	rm -rf *
	cd build 
	cmake .. 
	make -j2
	
To build submodule glew-2.2.0

	cd XCreator/vendor/glew-2.2.0
	mkdir -p build 
	rm -rf *
	cd build 
	cmake ./cmake
	make -j2
    
To avoid a link error for freetype-2.12.1

	cd XCreator/vendor/freetype-2.12.1/build
	sudo make install
