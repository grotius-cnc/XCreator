# Usage notes of XDesigner.

1. Start the XDesigner application.

	cd  XCreator/XDesignerDialog/build/
	./QDesignerDialog
	
2. Drag and drop the widgets to your needs. 

	"del" button can be used to remove widgets.
	"Mouse left button" is drag and drop.
	"Mouse right button" is for resize widgets. Widget resize works at widgets border if widgets are stacked.
	
3. Process layout code button.

	This will generate a "XTemplate.h" file in the build directory that can be used in your project.
	Hint -> Edit the XTemplate.h file to your needs, for example : XYourWidget.h
	Try to stay with the X.. format style.
